""" A simple parser for simple configuration or parameters files.

Python distribution ConfigParser module is great, but sometimes to much complicated
if you just need to store a basic key/value pairs list.

You'll find here a very basic function dealing with this kind of data, but offering nonetheless
a content overriding mechanism, based on a list of files loaded in turn. This way you can mimic
Linux common strategy consisting in using a system wide file /etc/killerapp.cfg, then a per-user
file ~/.killerapp.cfg and even a per-invocation named whatever you like.

Defaults values are also handled. But no variable interpolation yet.
